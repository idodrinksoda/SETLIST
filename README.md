# SETLIST
App to make setlists for bands

## Reordering songs
- Drag and drop songs in the Setlist view to change order. The drop target is now more precise and shows a subtle line where the item will land.
- Keyboard: select a song (click it, or Tab to it) and use Arrow Up/Arrow Down to move it.

## Notes
- Data is synced via Firebase once logged in. Reordering updates are saved immediately to the current setlist.
